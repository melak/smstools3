SMS Server Tools
Hardware Compatibility

My Software needs a GSM modem with SMS command set according to the european specifications 
GSM 07.05 (=ETSI TS 300 585) and GSM 03.38 (=ETSI TS 100 900).

When a vendor writes "SMS command set" without giving the
specification names, then the device typically supports a subset of
this specification. In this case you can surely send 7bit text messages
and you can probably receive them. But its not sure, if status reports,
binary messages or unicode messages work.

Mobile phones have more often compatibility issues than real GSM modems.

Probably all mobile phones support status report but you cannot
read them out with a computer. Status reports appear only on the phones display.

<h2>Serial adapter and converter</h2>

USB2Serial adpater cables, based on Prolific PL2303 chip
USB2Serial adpater cables, based on FTDI chips
USB2Serial adpater cables, based on Silabs CP2102 chip
Digi Etherlite ethernet to serial
Equinox multi Serial PCI cards

Note 1)
You must cut pin 4 (wich is DTR) of the serial connector because the phone
disables AT command set if the pin is connected and active. The GM22 does
not support ascii mode. Mode=new and baudrate=9600 are the correct settings.

Note 2)
Replace put_command("AT+CREG?\r"... with put_command("AT+CREG?\n"... in modeminit.c. Set baudrate=115200
and mode=new. This phone was reported as unstable by one user.

Note 3)
Enter "memory_start=0" into the config file. If you removed the PIN
protection from your SIM card, this modem says that the PIN is
locked, which is not true. Remove the pin=1234 line from the config
file, then the program will ignore that instead of stopping with an
error message. The linux driver for 3G/UMTS version can be loaded with
the command "modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0af0 product=0x5000". I assume
that loading the driver works similar for the other versions of that
card.
The device name is /dev/usb/ttyUSB0. 

Note 4)
On Linux, this Modem needs the HSO driver from http://www.pharscape.org. 
Disable hardware handshake with rtscts=no. When you need to receive messages, set the option memory_start=0.
